Create a program to solve a word jumble. The program should accept a string as input, and then return a list of words that can be created using the submitted letters. For example, on the input "dog", the program should return a set of words including "god", "do", and "go".

Constraint: Refrain from using any combinatorics helper modules or imports (e.g. itertools in Python).
